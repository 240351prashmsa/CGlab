Algorithm for ellipse generation: 
1. Input rx, ry, and ellipse center (xc, yc), and obtain the first point on an ellipse centered on the origin as 
(x0, y0) = (0, ry) 

2. Calculate the initial parameter in region 1 as 
p1 =r^2- r^2 r + 1/4 r^ 2
0  y    x      y      x 

3. At each xi position, starting at i = 0, if p1i < 0, the next point along the ellipse centered on (0, 0) is (xi + 1, yi) and 
p1 =p1 + 2 r² x +   r²
i+1 i      y   i+1  y 
Otherwise, the next point is (xi + 1, yi – 1) and 
p1 = p1 + 2 r ²x - 2 r²  y +  r²
i+ 1   I             y   i+1  y 
and continue until 
2 r² x >=2 r² y 
  y         x    
4.  (x0, y0) is the last position calculated in region 1. Calculate the initial parameter in region 2 as 
P20=r^2(x0+1/2)^2=R^2(y0-1)^2-r^2r^2
     Y              x          x y
5. At each yi position, starting at i = 0, if p2i > 0, the next point along the ellipse centered on (0, 0) is (xi, yi – 1) and 
p 2 = p 2 - 2 r² y +  r²
i+1   I        x i+1    x 
Otherwise, the next point is (xi + 1, yi – 1) and 
 p 2 = p2- 2 r² y +  r^2
 i-1     1   x  i+1   x 
Use the same incremental calculations as in region 1. Continue until y = 0. 
6. For both regions determine symmetry points in the other three quadrants. 
7. Move each calculated pixel position (x, y) onto the elliptical path centered on (xc, yc) and plot the coordinate values 
x = x + xc ,     y = y + yc
